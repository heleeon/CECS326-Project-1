"How to Run File Copy Program"
---

-  In the terminal, cd to the correct directory and type ```./filecopy.py``` to run the program
-  The program will ask for input for the file to *read* from. Make sure the file exists 
    - e.g. Type the file name: ```input.txt```
-  The program will ask for input for the file to *write* to.
    - e.g. Type the file name: ```copy.txt```
-  After inputting the files, the program will automatically call the fileCopy function. 
-  If everything works as expected, you should see the following output:
    - *"File successfully copied from input.txt to copy.txt! :D"*
